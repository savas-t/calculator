# Calculator Web Application

This is a simple JavaScript calculator browser application.

Try it out @ https://savas-t.github.io/calculator.

The purpouse of this project was to practice my JavaScript and CSS grid skills.

It's amazing how useful the CSS grid system is, and since a calculator is basically a grid of fields and buttons, this was a good way to practice it. Furthermore I am currently learning and practicing JavaScript, so adding the functionalities of a calculator with plain JS was a fun little project.
