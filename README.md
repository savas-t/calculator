# Calculator Web Application

This is a simple JavaScript calculator browser application. Try it out! https://savas-t.github.io/calculator

The purpouse of this project is for me to practice my JavaScript skills in general and my CSS Grid skills.

It's amazing how useful the CSS grid system is, and since a calculator is basically a grid of fields and buttons, this was a good way to practice it.

And since I am currently learning and practicing JavaScript, adding the functionalities of a calculator with plain JS was a good little practice.
